      " Sure! Let's say you want to create a program that can help you organize your daily tasks by setting reminders for each task. Here's what I came up with:\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we need to ask the user to input their tasks and set the reminder time. We'll use the `input()` function in Python to do this. \n",
      "\n",

      "# Prompt the user to enter their tasks\n",
      "tasks = input(\"Enter your daily tasks separated by commas: \")\n",

      "# Split the task string into a list of individual tasks\n",
      "task_list = tasks.split(\", \")\n",
      "\n",
      "# Ask the user for the reminder time in 24-hour format (HH:MM)\n",
      "reminder_time = input(\"What is your preferred reminder time? (Format: HH:MM) \")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, we need to check if the task list and reminder time are valid. We'll use regular expressions to make sure the user enters a valid 24-hour time in the format of H:M. If either input is invalid, we'll prompt them to enter again until they provide valid input. \n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import re\n",
      "\n",
      "# Check if the task list is empty or contains non-string values\n",
      "if not all(isinstance(task, str) for task in task_list):\n",
      "    print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a list of tasks separated by commas.\")\n",
      "elif len(task_list) == 0:\n",
      "    print(\"No tasks entered. Please try again.\")\n",

      "    # Check if the reminder time is valid\n",
      "    pattern = re.compile(r'^([01]\\d|2[0-3]):([0-5]\\d)$')  # Matches HH:MM format\n",

      "        print(\"Input is valid. Starting program...\")\n",
      "```\n",

      "Finally, we'll use the `datetime` module to generate the reminders for each task based on the user's preferred reminder time. \n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import datetime\n",
      "\n",

      "    # Generate a reminder for each task based on the user's preferred reminder time\n",
      "    task_date = datetime.datetime.strptime(task[:10], \"%Y-%m-%d\").date()  # Get date part of task\n",
      "    reminder_time = reminder_time + datetime.timedelta(minutes=30)  # Add 30 minutes to the reminder time\n",
      "    while reminder_time < datetime.datetime.now().replace(hour=12, minute=0):  # Check if reminder is before 12pm\n",
      "        print(\"Reminder for:\", task[10:])\n",
