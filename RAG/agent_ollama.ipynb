      "The terms \"agentic AI\" and \"AI agents\" are often used interchangeably, but they actually refer to different aspects of artificial intelligence. Here's the difference:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Agentic AI:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Agentic AI refers to a type of AI that is capable of making decisions and taking actions based on its own goals and motivations, similar to how humans do. In other words, agentic AI has a sense of self-awareness and autonomy. This allows the AI to make choices and act independently, without necessarily requiring human intervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, an autonomous vehicle with agentic AI would be able to navigate roads and make decisions about how to get from one place to another without needing constant human input.\n",
      "\n",
      "**AI agents:**\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, AI agents are simply software programs that perform specific tasks or services based on their programming. They don't have their own goals or motivations, but rather operate based on a set of predefined rules or algorithms. Think of them as virtual assistants that can help with specific tasks, but don't have the ability to make decisions or act independently like agentic AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, a chatbot designed to answer customer queries is an AI agent that can provide helpful responses based on its programming, but it doesn't have the ability to make decisions or act independently of its predefined script.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while both agentic AI and AI agents are forms of artificial intelligence, they differ in terms of their level of autonomy and decision-making capabilities. Agentic AI has a sense of self-awareness and autonomy, while AI agents operate based on predefined rules or algorithms without the ability to make decisions independently. *adjusts glasses again*\n"

      "Of course! Here are some Python interview questions suitable for freshers:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. What is Python and why is it popular?\n",
      "\t* Explain that Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It's widely used in web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.\n",
      "2. What are the basics of Python syntax?\n",
      "\t* Cover basic concepts such as indentation, comments, variables, data types (e.g., strings, lists, dictionaries), loops (for, while), conditional statements (if-else), functions, modules, and imports.\n",
      "3. How do you handle errors in Python?\n",
      "\t* Explain how to use try-except blocks to catch and handle errors, as well as the `raise` statement for customized error handling.\n",
      "4. What is a list in Python and how do you create it?\n",
      "\t* Define what a list is (a collection of items that can be of any data type) and explain how to create one using square brackets (`[]`). Provide examples of lists with different types of values.\n",
      "5. How do you manipulate lists in Python?\n",
      "\t* Discuss common list manipulation operations such as indexing, slicing, concatenating, reversing, filtering, and sorting. Give examples for each operation.\n",
      "6. What is a dictionary in Python and how do you create it?\n",
      "\t* Define what a dictionary is (a collection of key-value pairs) and explain how to create one using curly braces (`{}`). Provide examples of dictionaries with different types of keys and values.\n",
      "7. How do you work with files in Python?\n",
      "\t* Explain how to open, read from, write to, and close files in Python using the `open` function. Discuss different file modes (e.g., `r`, `w`, `a`) and give examples of file operations.\n",
      "8. What is a module in Python and how do you use it?\n",
      "\t* Define what a module is (a collection of related code) and explain how to import modules using the `import` statement. Provide examples of commonly used modules (e.g., `math`, `random`).\n",
      "9. How do you handle multi-line strings in Python?\n",
      "\t* Explain how to use triple quotes (`\"\"\"\"` or `'''``) for multi-line strings, and discuss the differences between them.\n",
      "10. Can you explain the difference between a class and an instance in Python?\n",
      "\t* Define what a class is (a blueprint for creating objects) and what an instance is (an actual object created from a class). Explain how to define classes and create instances, and discuss inheritance and polymorphism.\n",
      "\n",
      "These questions cover some of the basic concepts and functions of Python programming. Remember to keep your explanations clear and concise, and use markdown to format your answers for readability. Good luck with your interview!\n"
