      "The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, starting from 0 and 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Breaking it Down:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Sequence:** A list or arrangement of numbers in a particular order.\n",
      "*   **Fibonacci:** Named after Leonardo Fibonacci, an Italian mathematician who introduced this sequence to Europe in the 13th century. He used it to describe the growth of a population of rabbits!\n",
      "\n",
      "**How It Works:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  Start with 0 and 1 as the first two numbers in the sequence.\n",
      "2.  To get the next number in the sequence, add the last two numbers together.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Step 1:** 0 + 1 = 1 (new number)\n",
      "*   **Step 2:** 1 + 1 = 2 (new number)\n",
      "*   **Step 3:** 1 + 2 = 3 (new number)\n",
      "\n",
      "The resulting sequence is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3...\n",
      "\n",
      "This pattern continues indefinitely.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Real-World Applications:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Fibonacci numbers appear in nature and other areas of life:\n",

      "*   Leaf arrangement on stems\n",
      "*   Branching patterns of trees\n",
