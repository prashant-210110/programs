      "AI Agents vs Agentic AI:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **AI Agents**: Refers to artificial intelligence systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. These agents are often rule-based or machine learning models that operate within a predetermined framework. Examples include chatbots, virtual assistants, and self-driving cars.\n",
      "* **Agentic AI**: Is an AI system that has the ability to make decisions, take actions, and exhibit behaviors that are characteristic of human agency. Agentic AI is focused on creating autonomous systems that can interact with their environment and other agents in a way that is indistinguishable from a human. Examples include intelligent personal assistants, autonomous robots, and self-driving cars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key differences:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Decision-making**: AI Agents rely on predefined rules or machine learning algorithms to make decisions, while Agentic AI uses more advanced techniques like deep reinforcement learning to learn from experience and adapt to new situations.\n",
      "* **Autonomy**: Agentic AI is designed to operate independently, making decisions and taking actions without human intervention. AI Agents, on the other hand, typically require human oversight or input to function effectively.\n",
      "* **Behavioral realism**: Agentic AI aims to create more realistic and human-like behaviors, such as recognizing and responding to emotions, exhibiting common sense reasoning, and demonstrating a sense of purpose and motivation. AI Agents tend to be more limited in their behavioral repertoire.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while both types of AI have the potential to revolutionize various industries, Agentic AI is focused on creating autonomous systems that can exhibit human-like agency and decision-making abilities, whereas AI Agents are designed to perform specific tasks within a predetermined framework. 🤖\n"

      "Certainly! Here are some basic Python interview questions for freshers:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. What is Python and why do you want to learn it?\n",
      "\t* **Explanation:** Python is a popular high-level programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and ease of use. It's used in a wide range of applications, including web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. By learning Python, you can open up a variety of career opportunities in these fields.\n",
      "2. What are some basic Python concepts and how do you use them?\n",
      "\t* **Explanation:** In Python, you'll need to understand basic concepts like variables, data types, loops, conditional statements, functions, and modules. You can practice using these concepts by writing simple programs or scripts.\n",
      "3. Can you explain the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?\n",
      "\t* **Explanation:** Both lists and tuples are data structures in Python, but they have some key differences. Lists are mutable (can be changed), while tuples are immutable (cannot be changed). Tuples are also hashable, meaning they can be used in dictionaries.\n",
      "4. How do you handle errors and exceptions in Python?\n",
      "\t* **Explanation:** In Python, you can handle errors and exceptions using try-except blocks. The `try` block contains the code that might raise an error, while the `except` block specifies what to do when an error occurs. You can also use the `finally` block to perform some action regardless of whether an error occurred or not.\n",
      "5. How do you optimize the performance of a Python script?\n",
      "\t* **Explanation:** There are several ways to optimize the performance of a Python script, such as using efficient data structures (e.g., numpy arrays instead of lists), avoiding unnecessary function calls, and reducing the number of system calls. You can also use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks in your code.\n",
      "6. Can you explain the difference between a dictionary and a set in Python?\n",
      "\t* **Explanation:** Both dictionaries and sets are data structures in Python, but they have some key differences. Dictionaries are unordered (the order of items is not guaranteed), while sets are ordered (the order of items is guaranteed). Dictionaries can also store arbitrary data types as values, while sets only allow immutable objects.\n",
      "7. How do you implement a simple web scraper in Python?\n",
      "\t* **Explanation:** You can use the `requests` library to send HTTP requests and retrieve HTML pages from websites. Then, you can use the `BeautifulSoup` library to parse the HTML content and extract specific data. Finally, you can write the extracted data to a file or display it in a user interface.\n",
      "8. What are some common Python libraries for data analysis and visualization?\n",
      "\t* **Explanation:** Some popular Python libraries for data analysis and visualization include NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. These libraries provide efficient data structures and functions for working with numerical data, as well as tools for creating informative plots and visualizations.\n",
      "9. Can you explain the difference between a class and an object in Python?\n",
      "\t* **Explanation:** In Python, a class is a blueprint that defines the properties and methods of an object. An object is an instance of a class, with its own set of attributes (data) and behaviors (methods). The class defines the structure and behavior of the object, while the object contains the specific details and values.\n",
      "10. How do you implement multithreading in Python?\n",
      "\t* **Explanation:** In Python, you can use the `threading` module to implement multithreading. You can create a thread pool using the `Pool` class, or you can create separate threads for each task using the `Thread` class. You'll also need to handle communication between threads using synchronization primitives like locks and queues.\n",
